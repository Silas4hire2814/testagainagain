		<h1>Domain/Web hosting research</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>What is a web server?</h2>
		<p>A web server is a computer that stores html, javascript and css files as well images. This is important since it allows web users to access the internet!</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Why can't you just have a website without a domain?</h2>
		<p>Well its like buying something from Amazon and not having an house address to receive your package. A domain name is like your websites house address. It helps people find your website easier with easy to remember words. Without them, you have to enter in long number digits called IP addresses.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>What is a web hosting server and what does that mean?</h2>
		<p>You can't host your website without a web server. luckily certain companies will let you use their web servers to host your websites. Reliability, Speed, bandwidth and affordability are all factors in choosing a web hosting server</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Why must your domain name be unique?</h2>
		<p>Easy, that way when people look for your website, they know what do look for and and can find your site instead of multiple sites with the same name. </p>
		<hr>
		<h2>How much should a web server cost? </h2>
		<p>They are usually $5 to $8 a month unless you get a yearly plan. <br>When choosing a web hosting server, cost is the biggest factor for me since Amazon is a job that makes me want to die and I need to save all the money I can xd </p>
