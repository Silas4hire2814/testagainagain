<h1> I don't know what I am doing lol</h1>
<hr>
<p>My name is Silas Simpson. Nice to meet you! <em>I'm a 18 year old freshmen at Cascadia Community College!</em> I also work at Amazon on Mondays to Wednesdays from 8:15pm to 4:45am xd. <br>I was born in L.A California and lived there for either two or three years.I then moved to Dallas, Texas where I learned that mean people are way nicer than I would soon remember. Then I moved to Washington. I don't like Washington to be honest since the people are kind of mean. But I try my best to get a long with people.</p>
