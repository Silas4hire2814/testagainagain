<h1>Silas's Index page because he is slow and behind</h1>

Hi! My name is Silas Simpson and I am taking classes in web application and I am looking into careers in technology (although I seem to be bad at these types of things). This is my index page . I don't know what it is for and we are on the 5th/6th week of school. God I'm dumb.
<ul>
<li><a href="week-1/index.html">Week 1</a></li>
<li><a href="week-2-3/index.html">Weeks 2-3</a></li>
</ul>
