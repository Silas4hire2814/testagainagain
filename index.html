<p>Hi! My name is Silas Simpson and I am taking classes in web application and I am looking into careers in technology (although I seem to be bad at these types of things). This is my index page . I don't know what it is for and we are on the 5th/6th week of school. God I'm dumb.</p> 
<p>so for week 2 I learned about css and how to make things look pretty! I am still not that good at it but I am trying to make it look good. for example...EVERYTHING IS <b>BLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>
